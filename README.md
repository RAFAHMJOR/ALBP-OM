Assembly Line Balancing Problem Optimization Model (ALBP OM)

The objective of this study is to optimize the production line tasks for some known production facility, facility ABC, in order to maximize the efficiency of the assembly line at any given time with some probability of a line operator taking a vacation. To formulate this optimization, we utilized a dual stage optimization process to minimize the number of assembly workstations based on cycle time and task time.  Our model determined that the Assembly line efficiency for scenario 1 is 91.5% (no worker vacation) while efficiency decreases in scenario 2 to 84.8% efficiency (worker took vacation).  This decrease in efficiency highlights the impact that operator' skill level has on the assembly line layout.  Based on our results, we propose facility ABC adopts two different assembly line setup scenarios based on whether or not an operator has vacation scheduled.  This recommendation will help facility ABC maximize efficiency on any given day.
